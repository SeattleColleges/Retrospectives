# 📘 Application Development Practicum – Retrospectives

Welcome to the **Retrospectives Repository** for the Application Development Practicum.  
This space collects all practicum-wide retrospectives — structured, three-month reflections that focus on **team habits, collaboration, and continuous improvement**.

Each term (Fall, Winter, Spring, etc.) has its own GitHub Project board linked here.  
Use these retrospectives to share what’s working, what could improve, and what we’ll try next term.

## 🗺️ Finding Your Retrospective

Each retrospective is created as a **GitHub Project board** under this repository.  
To access one:

1. Go to the **Projects** tab at the top of this repo.  
2. Select the project for the current term, such as:
   - `Fall 2025 Retrospective`
   - `Winter 2026 Retrospective`
   - `Spring 2026 Retrospective`
3. Inside the board, you’ll see columns labeled **Agenda**, **Start**, **Stop**, **Continue**, and **Action Items**.  
   These represent our shared reflection space for that quarter.

## 🧭 What These Retrospectives Are

- **Not project-specific:** They cover the entire practicum experience, not just one client project.  
- **Continuous:** Each board runs for a full three-month term.  
- **Collaborative:** Everyone (PMs, Leads, Devs) can post items throughout the term.  
- **Cumulative:** We keep all boards for historical tracking to see how our practicum evolves.

## 🏷️ Label Reference

We use a shared set of **labels** to keep retrospectives organized and make themes easy to find.

| Label | Purpose |
|--------|----------|
| `blocked` | Something preventing progress or creating friction |
| `celebration` | Wins, shout-outs, or team highlights |
| `code-quality` | Topics about testing, maintainability, or technical debt |
| `communication` | Team alignment, clarity, or collaboration |
| `dev-environment` | Build issues, dependency conflicts, or setup pain points |
| `discussion-topic` | General feedback or open questions |
| `documentation` | Missing or outdated docs |
| `follow-up` | To revisit in the next retrospective |
| `handoff` | Leadership transitions or project rotations |
| `idea` | New improvement suggestions |
| `planning` | Sprint or schedule reflection |
| `tools` | Feedback on GitHub, Linear, or dev tools |
| `workflow` | Process, coordination, or task management topics |

> ✅ Tip: You can filter issues by label to quickly find related themes across multiple retrospectives.

## 👥 How to Contribute

1. Open the **current term’s project board**.  
2. Click **“New issue.”**  
3. Write a short title and brief description of your idea, challenge, or observation.  
4. Apply one or more **labels** to categorize it.  
5. Add it to the appropriate column (`Start`, `Stop`, `Continue`, etc.).  

Items can be added at any point during the term — retros are continuous, not one-time events.

---

## 🗓️ End of Term

At the end of each term:

- Facilitators will **close resolved items** (but keep them visible).  
- Any items marked `follow-up` will be **moved to the next term’s retrospective**.  
- The previous term’s board will remain accessible for historical tracking.
