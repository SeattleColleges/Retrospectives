# 🧭 Retrospective

This board is our **three-month retrospective space** for the Application Development Practicum.  
It’s where all practicum members reflect on collaboration, communication, and growth across the program — beyond individual projects.

Throughout the term, everyone is encouraged to share thoughts, wins, and lessons learned.  
At the end of the term, we’ll review these items together and identify clear action steps for improvement.

2. Add a short **title** and **description** explaining your observation, challenge, or idea.

4. Place the issue in the appropriate column (`Start`, `Stop`, `Continue`, or `Action Items`).

## ✅ During the Retrospective

When we meet as a group:

- Discuss items in each column openly.
- Group similar issues and look for patterns.
- Identify concrete **Action Items** with clear ownership or next steps.
- **Close** issues as they’re resolved — but leave them on the board for visibility and context.

---

## 🕰️ End of Term

- Closed items remain visible on the board for record-keeping.
- Items labeled `follow-up` will be carried into the next term’s retrospective.
- The final state of this board becomes a **snapshot** of our practicum culture and progress for the term.

---

## ✨ Purpose

This retrospective helps the practicum:

- Reflect on teamwork, leadership, and workflow habits
- Celebrate progress and recognize contributions
