# 🧭 Retrospective Template

This template provides a **standard structure for three-month retrospectives** across the Application Development Practicum.  
It helps all practicum members reflect on habits, collaboration, and communication at the **program level**, not within individual client projects.

Participants can use this board to contribute feedback and ideas throughout the term.  
Admins (facilitators) can duplicate it for each new term and manage discussions during retrospective sessions.

## 🗂️ Board Structure

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|----------|
| **Agenda ✏️** | Talking points or guiding questions for reflection. |
| **Start 🟢** | New habits or ideas we should begin exploring. |
| **Stop 🟡** | Habits or workflows that cause friction and should end. |
| **Continue 🟣** | Practices or tools that are working well and should continue. |
| **Action Items 🔵** | Final, agreed-upon improvements and next steps. |

---

## 🏷️ Label System

Labels help categorize feedback and reveal patterns across terms.

| Label | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `blocked` | Something preventing progress or causing workflow friction |
| `celebration` | Wins, shout-outs, or highlights |
| `code-quality` | Maintainability, testing, or technical debt topics |
| `communication` | Alignment, team interaction, or feedback flow |
| `dev-environment` | Local setup issues, builds, or dependencies |
| `discussion-topic` | General thoughts or open questions |
| `documentation` | Missing or unclear documentation |
| `follow-up` | Needs review in the next retrospective |
| `handoff` | Role transitions or project shifts |
| `idea` | New suggestions or experiments |
| `planning` | Sprint or term planning reflections |
| `tools` | Feedback on GitHub, Linear, Miro, etc. |

## 👥 For Participants

### 💬 How to Contribute

1. Click **“New issue”** on this board.
2. Add a clear **title** and short **description** of your observation, blocker, or idea.
3. Apply one or more **labels** that match your feedback.
4. Place your issue under the most relevant column (`Start`, `Stop`, `Continue`, etc.).
5. React to or comment on other issues to add input before or during the retrospective meeting.

---

### ✅ During the Retrospective

- Discuss items openly during the session.
- Help group related issues together for clarity.
- Suggest realistic **Action Items** that the practicum can complete within the next term.
- After discussion, mark issues as **closed** once resolved — but keep them visible on the board for transparency.

---

### 🕰️ Timeframe

This board represents a **three-month period** (one academic term).  
Issues remain open throughout the term for ongoing reflection.  
When resolved, items are closed but not removed, preserving a visible record of progress and lessons learned.

## 🧑‍💼 For Admins (Facilitators)

### 🏗️ Setup

1. **Duplicate this project** and rename it for the new term  
   → Example: `Winter 2026 Retrospective`
2. **Review and update this README** if any term-specific context is needed.
3. Confirm that all **labels** match the shared practicum label standard.
4. Add guiding questions or themes to the **Agenda** column before the first check-in.
5. Invite all practicum members (PMs, Leads, Devs, Writers) to contribute freely during the term.

---

### 🧩 Running the Retrospective

- Encourage participants to post throughout the quarter, not just at the end.
- During live sessions, **sort issues** into the appropriate columns.
- Use **labels** to identify themes (communication, workflow, etc.).
- Summarize next steps under **Action Items** and assign owners if needed.
- Close items when addressed but **keep them visible** for historical context.

---

### 📦 Archiving

At the end of each term:

1. **Close all completed items** to mark progress.
2. Add a `follow-up` label to items that need attention next term.
3. **Duplicate this project** for the next quarter (e.g., “Spring 2026 Retrospective”).
4. Store all past retrospectives in the **Retrospective repository** to track long-term cultural and process improvements.

---

## ✨ Purpose

The retrospective process helps the practicum:

- Identify recurring challenges and celebrate successes
- Improve cross-team communication and collaboration
- Encourage continuous growth and accountability
- Document how the practicum evolves each term
